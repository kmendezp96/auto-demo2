Feature: As a possible buyer
  I want to search and filter articles
  So I can find what I want to buy

  Scenario: search by category and a keyword and ordering results by price
    Given the user is in the olx page
    When the user searches for "Video juegos - Consolas" category
    And the user searches for "Mario" keyword
    And the user sorts results in ascendant price
    Then 5 first results should be in ascendant price order
    And 5 first results should include the keyword "Mario"
